# Docker-MultiContainerAppThis is a Fibonacci calculator application, built using Docker, ExpressJS, ReactJS, PostgresDB, RedisDB, and Nginx.

I integrated Git with TravisCI control my code, build new images and push them to DockerHub.

At the end I used ElasticBeanstalk application, also integrated with TravisCI, for deploying my application and finishing whole CI-CD pipeline.
